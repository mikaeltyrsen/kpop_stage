# Media directory

Place your video assets in this folder.

- `default_loop.mp4`: the fullscreen loop that plays when no selection is active.
- `videos/`: store the individual music video files referenced by `videos.json`.

These files are not tracked in the repository so you can add your own media without committing large binaries.
